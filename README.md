# Space-invaders
Space-invaders, the well-known video-game, is another grid-based game I coded by myself. However it's extremely simplified with only a few lines of basic
CSS-Code. So feel free to add ur own design to it!

## Try it out

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m1rels/space-invaders
   ```

2. In VS Code go to index.html, right-click and choose "Open with Live Server". You should see the game popping up in your browser.
